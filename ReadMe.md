1. Create an S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Table for Remote State
-   S3 Bucket: Used to store the Terraform state file, which keeps track of resources managed by Terraform.
-   DynamoDB Table: Used for state locking to prevent concurrent modifications to the state file.

2. Define Terraform Configuration
-   Variables: Define variables to manage input values like AWS region, VPC CIDR, subnet CIDR blocks, instance type, and SSH key name.
-   Provider Configuration: Set up the AWS provider configuration to use environment variables for AWS credentials.
-   VPC and Subnets: Create a VPC and define public and private subnets within this VPC.
-   Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway: Set up an Internet Gateway for the public subnet and a NAT Gateway for the private subnet.
-   Routing: Configure routing tables for public and private subnets to route traffic appropriately.
-   Security Groups: Create security groups to manage inbound and outbound traffic for the instances.
-   EC2 Instances: Launch EC2 instances in the public and private subnets.

3. Configure Remote State Storage
-   backend.tf: Configure Terraform to store the state file in an S3 bucket and use a DynamoDB table for state locking.
4. Provide Variable Values
-   terraform.tfvars: Provide values for the variables defined in the configuration.


- Run `terraform init` to initialize the terraform
- Run `terraform plan` to check for the total resources to provision
- Run `terraform apply` to implement the script.
